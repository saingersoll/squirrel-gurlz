    "Seaborn is a data visualization library with the same functionality as ggplots in R studio. In particular, it’s most widely used to make statistical graphics in Python and integrates closely with the panda datasets. Seaborn plotting functions operates on data frames and performs mapping and statistical aggregation to produce meaningful plots. Some other important functions to note is distributional representations, statistical estimation, plots for categorical data, multivariate views on complex datasets and most importantly making good and effective plots in communication. At its base, seaborn uses matplotlib to drawr its plots and it’s recommended to use it in conjunction with Jupyter/Python. "
